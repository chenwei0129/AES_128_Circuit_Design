# AES Circuit Design

## Using AES algorithm to encrypt/decrypt the message.

## THere are three versions of the circuit, the functions are the same, just difference from their architecture.

* V1

      A typical AES circuit, and the module "key expansion" is a combinational circuit, generate 10 keys at a time. res
* V2
* V3
