Big mouthfuls ofter choke.
Better an empty purse than an empty head.
Constant dropping wears the stone.
To read without reflecting is like eating without digesting.
The important thing in life is to have a great aim, and the determination to attain it.
Experience is the mother of wisdom.
Asking costs nothing.
The important thing in life is to have a great aim, and the determination to attain it.
Bind the sack before it be full.
Nothing is impossible to a willing heart.
Pursue your object, be it what it will, steadily and indefatigably.
Bind the sack before it be full.
All things are difficult before they are easy.
Every man is his own worst enemy.
From small beginnings comes great things.
